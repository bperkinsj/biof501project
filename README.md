# Rough Draft

## Welcome to the repository for my BIOF 501 project!

Here you will find all information of note in the universe. Every morsel, every tidbit, lovingly tidied over and tucked into their proper positions. You need read nothing else to understand all that has occurred, is occurring, and will occur within this beautiful fallacy we call reality.

Birds are a very diverse group of vertebrates. The most diverse, in fact, and within this diversity is an extraordinary range of physical characteristics and abilities. Hummingbirds have heart rates that can vary from 1000 bpm when excited to 50 bpm when at rest. Owls have eyes so large that they cannot turn them in their sockets, and must instead rotate their heads up to 270 degrees to make up for this. Arctic terns migrate 70,900 km per year in their trips from their breeding grounds in Iceland and Greenland to their wintering grounds in Antarctica and back.



## Dependencies and versions
Python 3.6.3

Diamond 0.9.24

Snakemake 3.13.3

IQTree 2.1.4_beta

MAFFT 7.505

Orthofinder 2.5.4


## Installation
Created a snakemake environment using conda named biof501. I will use this for my project.

Managed to get orthofinder to work through conda. Had to update diamond to the recommended version.

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
