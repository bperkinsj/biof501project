# BIOF501 Term Project: Generating the (Partial) Avian Phylogenetic Tree

### _By Brooks Perkins-Jechow_

## Overview

Birds are a very diverse group of vertebrates. To be precise, they are the most diverse (species-wise) of all tetrapod vertebrates [[1]](#references), and among these species is an extraordinary range of physical characteristics and abilities. Hummingbirds have heart rates that can vary from 1000 bpm when excited to 50 bpm when at rest. Owls have eyes so large that they cannot turn them in their sockets, and must instead rotate their heads up to 270 degrees. Arctic terns migrate 70,900 km per year in their trips from their breeding grounds in Iceland and Greenland to their wintering grounds in Antarctica and back. These varied capabilities imply an equally varied genetic makeup, a makeup which already informs our understanding of fields such as neuroscience, developmental biology, and immunology [[2]](#references)[[3]](#references)[[4]](#references).

This genetic variety also makes resolving the evolutionary tree an exceedingly difficult task. Multiple attempts have been made, each differing from the last, and studies continue to add to the pile[5](#references). Pinning down the phylogenetic placement of a specific bird - the hoatzin, a South American bird exhibiting a host of bizarre traits such as having clawed wing digits at birth - has been so difficult that it's become a joke in the phylogenetic community [[6]](#references)[[7]](#references)[[8]](#references). 

Several species of birds, including the chicken (Gallus gallus), pigeon (rock dove) (Columba livia), and zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata), are already counted among the model research species in such fields as neuroscience and developmental biology (2).

### Species of interest

Species selected based on the IOC World Bird List Version 12.2 

Common name, species name (order, infraclass)

Little spotted kiwi, _Apteryx owenii_ (Apterygiformes, Galeoagnathae)

Helmeted guineafowl, _Numida meleagris_ (Galliformes, Galloanseres)

Mallard, _Anas platyrhynchos_ (Anseriformes, Galloanseres)

Eurasian sparrowhawk, _Accipiter nisus_ (Accipitriformes, Neoaves)

## Dependencies and versions

Python=3.6.13

Diamond=0.9.24

Snakemake=3.13.3

IQTree=2.1.4_beta

MAFFT=7.505

Orthofinder=2.5.4

Perl=5.26.2

Plottree=0.0.2

BioPython=1.79

Graphviz=2.42.2-3build2

## Installation

Created a snakemake environment using conda named biof501. I will use this for my project.

Managed to get orthofinder to work through conda. Had to update diamond to the recommended version.

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

You will also have to install graphviz.

```
sudo apt install graphviz
```

## Results

The message spit out by CompareTree in the terminal should look like this:

```
Splits  Found   3       Total   6       Frac    0.5     MaxLnDf 0.0124  Ratio   1.74    MaxBtDf 0.918
```
